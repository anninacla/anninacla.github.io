I am a current PhD candidate in Sociology, housed between CREST (Institut Polytechnique de Paris) and the Sciences Po Médialab in Paris, France. I am supervised by Étienne Ollion and Sylvain Parasie.

Broadly defined, I am interested in how public figures navigate pressures to maintain an active online presence. More specifically, my PhD thesis focuses on MPs and the factors that shape the diversity of practices we can observe in (online and offline) political communication. I also keep a foot in digital journalism studies, and am particularly interested in dynamics related to online violence and hate speech.

In my research, I combine qualitative and computational methods, and I am a part of the Computational Social Science @ Paris Saclay group. I also teach undergraduate and postgraduate courses on methods and digital sociology.
