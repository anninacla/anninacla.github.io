I am currently a PhD candidate splitting my time between CREST (Institut Polytechnique de Paris) and the médialab of Sciences Po, supervised by Étienne Ollion and Sylvain Parasie. In my thesis, I study how social media affects everyday political work, focusing on the French Assemblée Nationale.

Broadly, I am interested in how public figures navigate online spaces. Previously, I have worked on digital safety for journalists both academically and in IGO settings. Methodologically, I mix qualitative and computational approaches.
